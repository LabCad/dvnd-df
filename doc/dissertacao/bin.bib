	Abstract = {Abstract Data-flow is a natural approach to parallelism. However, describing dependencies and control between fine-grained data-flow tasks can be complex and present unwanted overheads. \{TALM\} (TALM is an Architecture and Language for Multi-threading) introduces a user-defined coarse-grained parallel data-flow model, where programmers identify code blocks, called super-instructions, to be run in parallel and connect them in a data-flow graph. \{TALM\} has been implemented as a hybrid Von Neumann/data-flow execution system: the Trebuchet. We have observed that TALM's usefulness largely depends on how programmers specify and connect super-instructions. Thus, we present Couillard, a full compiler that creates, based on an annotated C-program, a data-flow graph and C-code corresponding to each super-instruction. We show that our toolchain allows one to benefit from data-flow execution and explore sophisticated parallel programming techniques, with small effort. To evaluate our system we have executed a set of real applications on a large multi-core machine. Comparison with popular parallel programming methods shows competitive speedups, while providing an easier parallel programing approach. More specifically, for an application that follows the wavefront method, running with big inputs, Trebuchet achieved up to 4.7\% speedup over Intel{\textregistered} \{TBB\} novel flow-graph approach and up to 44\% over OpenMP. },

Large batches of these tasks may be executed on high-end computing systems, however, the coordination of the independent processes, their data, and their data dependencies is a significant scalability challenge. Many problems must be addressed, including load balancing, data distribution, notifications, concurrent programming, and linking to existing codes. In this work, we present Swift/T, a programming language and runtime that enables the rapid development of highly concurrent, task-parallel applications. Swift/Tis composed of several enabling technologies to address scalability challenges, offers a high-level optimizing compiler for user programming and debugging, and provides tools for binding user code in C/C++/Fortran into a logical script. In this work, we describe the Swift/T solution and present scaling results from the IBM Blue Gene/Pand Blue Gene/Q.},

TERAFLUX is a Future and Emerging Technology (FET) large-scale project funded by the European Union, which addresses such challenges at once by leveraging the dataflow principles. This paper presents an overview of the research carried out by the TERAFLUX partners and some preliminary results. Our platform comprises 1000+ general purpose cores per chip in order to properly explore the above challenges. An architectural template has been proposed and applications have been ported to the platform. Programming models, compilation tools, and reliability techniques have been developed. The evaluation is carried out by leveraging on modifications of the HP-Labs COTSon simulator.}},
